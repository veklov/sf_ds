### What problem are we solving?

Some job seekers do not indicate their desired salary when writing their resume. This is an obstacle for the Head Hunter recommendation system, which selects a list of the most suitable positions for job seekers and a list of the most suitable specialists for employers.

Before building a model, the data must be transformed, examined and cleaned. This is our task!

**Conditions of competition:**

- Carefully study the task details.
- Download the already familiar dataset and notebook template.
- Be sure to familiarize yourself with the additional theoretical material that is given before the task.
- Use our tips and hints when completing the project.
- Answer all the control questions: for them, you can score a maximum of 30 points on the platform.
- Upload the notebook with your solution to GitHub, formatting it in accordance with the requirements.
- Submit the project for review and receive 10 points (including 8 points for the main task and 2 points for the additional one) for the conclusions on the intelligence analysis.
- Receive feedback from the course team.
