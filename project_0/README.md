### What problem are we solving?
Write a program that guesses the number using the minimum number of attempts

**Conditions of competition:**
- The computer thinks of a whole number from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. The "guess" means "to write a program that guesses the number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is more or less than what we need.

**Quality metrics**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions

**What we will practice**
Learn to write good code in Python
