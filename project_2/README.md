### What problem are we solving?

Some job seekers do not indicate their desired salary when writing their resume. This is an obstacle for the Head Hunter recommendation system, which selects a list of the most suitable positions for job seekers and a list of the most suitable specialists for employers.

Before building a model, the data must be transformed, examined and cleaned. We have already studied how to work with data in python, now our task to lern how to work with data stored in RDBMS using SQL.


**What we will practice:**

Techniques of working with relational data using SQL
